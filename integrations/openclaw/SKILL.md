# DevMind Integration for OpenClaw

DevMind provides your agent with persistent memory, context slicing, and deep codebase understanding.

## Setup

Ensure `devmind` is available in your environment.

```bash
npm install -g devmind
devmind init
```

## Capabilities

### 1. Context Slicing (Codebase Navigation)

Instead of reading all files, use `devmind context` to get a map.

```bash
# Get high-level map
devmind context

# Focus on a specific module
devmind context --focus packages/database
```

### 2. Persistent Memory (Learning)

When you make a decision or learn a pattern, save it.

```bash
devmind learn "Always use repository pattern for DB access" --category "architecture"
```

_Note: This saves to `LEARN.md` so future agents (including you) can access it._

### 3. Database Awareness

Before writing SQL or modifying schema, analyze usage.

```bash
devmind analyze
```

### 4. History Tracking

See what changed recently to understand current state.

```bash
devmind history
```

## Workflow Example

1.  **Start Task**: Run `devmind context` to orient yourself.
2.  **Plan**: Read `AGENTS.md` (generated by scan) for architecture rules.
3.  **Execute**:
    - If modifying DB: `devmind analyze`.
    - If reading code: `devmind context --focus <path>`.
4.  **Finish**:
    - `devmind learn` any new patterns.
    - `devmind scan` to update context for next agent.
